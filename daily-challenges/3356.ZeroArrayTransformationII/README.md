# 📌 Step-by-Step Approach to Solve `minZeroArray`

## 📝 Problem Understanding
We are given:
- An array `nums` of size `n`.
- A list of `queries`, where each query consists of `[start, end, value]`.  
  - This means we subtract `value` from all elements in `nums` within the range `[start, end]`.
- Our goal is to find the **minimum number of queries** required to make **all elements in `nums` non-positive** (sum becomes zero).

---

## 🏗 Approach
### Step 1: Use Binary Search on the Number of Queries
- We need to find the **smallest number of queries** (`limit`) that makes `nums` zero.
- Since applying more queries can only make `nums` decrease, we can use **binary search** on `limit`.

### Step 2: Efficiently Apply Queries Using a Difference Array
- Instead of applying queries directly (which is slow), we use a **difference array** (`delta`) to optimize the update process.
- The difference array allows us to apply `O(1)` updates for range modifications.

## 🚀 Algorithm Breakdown

### **Function: `canMakeZeroArray(nums, queries, limit)`**
1. **Create a Difference Array** (`delta`) of size `n + 1` and initialize it to zero.
2. **Apply the First `limit` Queries Efficiently**:
   - For each query `[start, end, value]`:
     - Subtract `value` at `start` (`delta[start] -= value`).
     - Add `value` back at `end + 1` (`delta[end + 1] += value`) to restore values beyond `end`.
3. **Apply Updates and Check if Sum Becomes Zero**:
   - Traverse `nums` while applying cumulative effects from `delta`.
   - If any element remains **positive**, return `false`.
   - Otherwise, return `true`.

### **Function: `minZeroArray(nums, queries)`**
1. **Compute Initial Sum** of `nums`. If it is already `0`, return `0`.
2. **Perform Binary Search on `limit`**:
   - `left = 1`, `right = queries.length`, `result = -1`.
   - While `left <= right`:
     - Find `mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.
     - Call `canMakeZeroArray(nums, queries, mid)`.
     - If `true`, update `result = mid` and search for a smaller value (`right = mid - 1`).
     - If `false`, increase `limit` (`left = mid + 1`).
3. **Return the Minimum `limit`** that works.

## ⏳ Time Complexity Analysis
- **Binary Search:** `O(log m)`, where `m = queries.length`
- **Checking a `limit`:** `O(n + limit)`, since we use a difference array.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n log m)`, which is efficient.

## ✅ Example Walkthrough
### **Input:**
```javascript
nums = [3, 1, 2];
queries = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [0, 2, 3]];
```

### **Binary Search Steps:**
`mid = 2` → Apply first 2 queries → nums is still not zero → Increase limit
`mid = 3` → Apply all 3 queries → nums becomes zero → Found answer.

### **Output:**
```javascript
minZeroArray(nums, queries); // Output: 3
```

## 🎯 Summary
- Binary search on limit ensures minimal queries are used.
- Difference array optimizes range updates to O(1).
- Overall complexity is O(n log m), which is efficient.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum number of queries needed to make nums non-positive. 🚀
