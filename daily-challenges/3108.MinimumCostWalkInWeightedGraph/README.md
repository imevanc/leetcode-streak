# Minimum Cost Walk In Weighted Graph
## 1️⃣ Preprocess the Graph with DFS 🏗️
DFS for Connected Components: We use DFS to identify the connected components in the graph. Once a component is discovered, we don't need to revisit it for each query—it's already tagged and grouped!
Precomputing AND Values: During DFS, we also calculate the minimum AND value for the edges in each connected component. This saves us from recalculating the AND value for every query. You only do the work once, and it pays off later.
## 2️⃣ Query like a 🔍
Checking Components: If two nodes belong to different components, you don’t need to go through the graph again—return -1 because they aren't connected. Fast check, fast answer.
Optimised Responses: If two nodes are in the same component, just return the precomputed AND value for that component. No need to search through edges again—it's like magic! 🚀
## Why This Is Built Different? 🦍
### Time Complexity:
Preprocessing (DFS to group nodes and calculate AND values): O(n + e), where n is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges. It’s linear in terms of the graph size, which is optimal.
Query Processing: Each query is answered in O(1) time, thanks to precomputing the components and AND values. Imagine asking thousands of questions and getting instant replies. That’s a BIG W.
The total complexity becomes O(n + e + q), where q is the number of queries. This is absolute efficiency—the graph is processed once, and then you breeze through the queries.
### Space Complexity:
O(n) for storing the component array (for tracking which node belongs to which component) and the adjacency list. It’s very space-efficient, using only what’s necessary to store the graph and components.
## Why Is This OP? 🤔
No Redundant Computations: The key here is that you’re precomputing everything upfront. Once DFS is done, you don’t need to do any extra work. You essentially "cache" the answers for later use.
Faster Than BFS: BFS typically explores all nodes level by level, which can be slow. But DFS lets you directly find all nodes in a connected component, saving a ton of unnecessary checks. For each query, you’ve already got the answer ready to go in O(1) time.
## In Summary
You preprocess the graph efficiently with DFS, store the results, and then answer queries in constant time. You’re saving time and space by avoiding unnecessary recalculations and making every query an instant response.
The solution is optimised, elegant, and scalable, making it perfect for handling large graphs with many queries. 🏆
