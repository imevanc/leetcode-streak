# Alternatig Groups II

### Intuition
This function numberOfAlternatingGroups appears to count the number of valid "alternating groups" in a circular array, where a valid alternating group is defined as a sequence of at least k consecutive elements where adjacent colors are different.

### Approach
We use a sliding window technique that wraps around the circular array, checking len+k-1 positions (where len is the length of the colors array).
As we iterate through the array:
1. We use modulo (%) to handle the circular nature of the array, so after reaching the end, we wrap back to the beginning.
2. valid keeps track of the current streak of alternating colors we've encountered.
3. When adjacent colors differ (colors[prevIdx] !== colors[currIdx]), we increment valid.
4. When adjacent colors are the same, we reset valid to 1 (starting a new potential streak).
5. Whenever valid reaches or exceeds k, we count it as a valid alternating group.


The counter accumulates the total number of valid alternating groups found.
<br/><strong>The key insight</strong> is that by checking len+k-1 positions (rather than just len), we ensure we catch alternating groups that wrap around from the end of the array back to the beginning.
